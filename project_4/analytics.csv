The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at 12R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MITI Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest for this engineering position in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. in each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.   Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 1.0x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data,   Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 1.00X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.   Online Deep Learning: Towards Near RealTime (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential.   Extreme Deep Learning: Training IB neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training   Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players.   White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications - especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions   Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of Images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.      ","$2,500to$5,000",Monthly,Professional,analytics

Reporting of the role This role reports to the Senior Vice President of Xaxis APAC. 3 best things about the job:  Direct and immediate impact to business Extraordinary growth and learning opportunities within APAC and beyond Highly visible position with clients, agencies, and other industry leaders  Measures of success In three months:  Complete understanding of team responsibilities, areas of focus, and engagement across regional and local teams You will have a firm understanding of where Xaxis “data” resides, it’s value, and be able to access it with ease  In six months:  You will become confident in your capabilities and be able to independently support regional and local markets on their requests and problems You will provide input to regional leadership on strategic direction and areas of potential growth & development for the team  In 12 months:  You will become a confident team leader and regional spokesperson for marketing science and insights & analytics to other regional leads You will provide strategic guidance and direction to our client strategy team as it pertains to marketing science and the responsibilities described in this job description  Overview and Responsibilities of the role: The role of Director of Marketing Science will, put simply, ‘make data happen’ for Xaxis APAC – and is a key role given the growth of data-driven marketing, and the key opportunity for programmatic media in this space. The role will involve a combination of “building” our capabilities in the area of data, insights & analytics – to be applied across all countries, teams and clients in APAC – together with directly “executing” these capabilities across our key regional clients. As with data and it’s broad application across the business, the role will have the opportunity to work closely with a passionate and senior team of experts in programmatic advertising – experts in the areas of client strategy, supply, platforms and technology, product development and so on. While you will be data ‘smart’ and analytically-minded, you will become even more so, and you will inspire and guide others to do the same. You know a lot, but you don’t know everything, and you’re happy to admit it. You fill this gap through questions, seeking learning opportunities (formal and informal), and aligning with smart people. The Director of Marketing Science will play a critical role in supporting the success of Xaxis, by leading with a strategic, data-driven, and performance-focussed mind-set. ‘Strategic’ in the sense that you can generate different options, and make decisions that drive best long-term value for Xaxis.  The pros and cons may not be obvious. The small things can make a big difference. The quickest solutions might not be the best. It might take many small steps to get the outcome we ultimately want. ‘Data-driven’, in that you use data for informing everyday decisions (internally), and apply widely to client and campaign solutions (externally). ‘Performance-focussed’ in that you know internal stakeholder, client and agency expectations, and you focus on delivering to these. And you know what makes sense, and what doesn’t, and how to influence. This role will have a broad remit to make best possible use of all available forms of data to improve campaign performance, increase profitability and revenue, and ultimately the value that Xaxis delivers to clients. Of course, the challenge is taking this data and turning it into meaningful insights that can be acted upon in a timely way. While formally sitting within the Marketing Science team, the role will have significant involvement across the business, in a truly cross-functional team, such as in the planning of new products, optimisation of campaign performance, ideas for new campaign outcomes, or the marketing of the value that Xaxis delivers.   Specifically, these are the areas of Focus:  Revenue Growth Measurement & Advanced Analytics Outcomes Custom Insights & Deep dives Team Management  Revenue Growth: Engage in projects and initiatives with our regional client strategy team and local markets, where our analytical insights and guidance will yield in the increased spend by a client and or the shifting of budget from competitors to Xaxis advertising products: This will include, but not limited to:  Ensuring clear campaign KPIs, and measurement (metrics and tracking) Strong Analytics Plans (including Brand Impact Studies, Attribution, etc) Strong Audience Plans (driven by Insights, as well as delivering new Insights) Significant application of data (audience and beyond) Driving consistency and quality across markets Benchmarking and quantifying the value of Xaxis to key stakeholders  Measurement & Advanced Analytics: Produce advanced analytics and reports for clients that address direct and indirect business objectives, problems and decisions, yielding actionable insights that help drive improved campaign performance and or demonstrate measurable value.

Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Leaming 2.0 project:  Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with !Ox fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts ofunlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10 s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are I00x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always­ learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning: Training lB neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing  amounts of data and model  size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and appl ications involving critical decisions. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of  bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between  entities,  to improve classification accuracy.  ","$4,500to$9,000",Monthly,Professional,analytics

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualization solutions. For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU.  Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.  Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible.  The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples.  This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware.  The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system.  Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning: Training 1B neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance.  However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.","$4,500to$9,000",Monthly,Professional,analytics

The platform is an open public-private one with government playing the role of a neutral and trusted data-broker to multilateralise data-sharing for health innovation and service delivery. This project has the ambition to create a step-improvement in health promotion and chronic disease management, pioneering capabilities with tech giants to front global-first co-innovation. It will also allow for the real time tracking of the Singapore population's health behaviours, and potentially give Government a much more accurate read of how the population responds to policy changes and allow for personalised services delivered at national scale.  By providing a research platform for new medical interventions, it has the potential to accelerate the adoption of a whole range of clinical interventions.  The project will involve a range private sector players coming in to use Singapore as a test bed to trial new products and services in precision health and medicine.  Key technologies that are likely to be trialled in this project are health related wearable and sensor technology, big data analytics, machine learning, behavioural science, genomics and precision medicine.      The Strategy and Industry Lead will assist the Coordinating Director to:    Strategise, plan and formulate the vision, implementation strategy and roadmap (including workstreams, team structures, timelines and budgets) for TeNHP; Reach out, assess, prioritise and implement key partnerships with private sector leaders in technology and healthcare sector to participate on our platform.
